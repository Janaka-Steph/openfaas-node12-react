= React.js SPA

== Issue #1

The `function/build` folder is not pushed into the container.

Step to reproduce:

.In one tab
 kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n openfaas 8080:8080

.In a other tab
 cd function

 npm i

 npm run build

 cd ..

 faas up

A workaround is to add a build step to the node12 template's Dockerfile.


== Issue #2

Everything works fine locally with `npm start`.
The `Dancing Script` font is applied, and the pokemon image is displayed.

In production, having a build folder in place, the font is not applied, and the image is not displayed.

The paths and mime types are correct.
